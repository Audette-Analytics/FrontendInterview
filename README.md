**Take-Home Assignment: Buildings List Application**

**Objective:** Create a high-quality application that displays a list of buildings. Assume the existing application was developed by a junior developer.

**Instructions:**

1. **Fetch Initial Data:** Update `API_ADDRESS` in `constants.jsx` to use a unique identifier of your choosing. This will ensure that the data you're working with is yours and not that of another candidate.
2. **Loading State:** Implement a loading state to handle the initial data fetch.
3. **Usability Improvements:** Address any usability issues you encounter while using the app.

**Time Estimate:** This task should take approximately 2-3 hours to complete.

To get started, run:

```shell
npm install
```
```shell
npm start
```
