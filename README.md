**Take-Home Assignment: Buildings List Application**

**Objective:** Create a high-quality application that displays a list of buildings. Assume the existing application was developed by a junior developer.

**Instructions:**

1. **Initial Setup:** Update `API_ADDRESS` in `constants.jsx` to use a unique identifier of your choosing. This will ensure that the data you're working with is yours and not that of another candidate.
1. **Add Building:** This feature doesn't work quite right. Find and fix the bug.
1. **Loading State:** The underlying API is a bit slow. Implement a loading state so the user knows what's going on.
1. **Usability Improvements:** What other usability issues or bugs could use some attention? Improve or change whatever else you like. Feel free to provide an explanation of each additional change you make: Why was the change necessary/desirable, and why did you choose that particular solution?

**Time Estimate:** This task should take approximately 2-3 hours to complete.

To get started, run:

```shell
npm install
```
```shell
npm start
```
